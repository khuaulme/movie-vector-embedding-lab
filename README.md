### MongoDB Atlas Vector Search Workshop

<h4 style="color:green">Looking to power an artificial intelligence with long term memory that could take over the world? Or maybe something simpler like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), semantic search, recommendation engines, or dynamic personalization. It all starts with the ability to search across vector embeddings.</h4>

<p>In this lesson, using a sample movie dataset and a free forever MongoDB Atlas cluster, you will semantically search for movies based on their plot. Semantic search is searching across data using <i>intent</i> and <i>contextual meaning</i> for more relevant results. This means you can search for <code>cop</code> instead of <code>police man </code> and find both (and then some). Whereas full-text search will only allow you to find words by spelling, not the general meaning. You know what I mean. ðŸ˜‰

This workshop will teach you how to

- Create vector embeddings from the plots of movie documents.
- Leverage the data model to store those vector embeddings alongside your other data fields.
- Index your movie documents using knn, a similarity function, and the dimensions of the encoding model <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code> found on Hugging Face.

<br/>

<p>This application was created using:</p>

- Node.js
- Hugging Face sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- The Atlas sample dataset of sample_mflix.movies

learn to create vector embeddings with machine learning models like OpenAI and Hugging Face. Then store those embeddings directly in MongoDB Atlas. Once in Atlas, use $vectorSearch to

<h2>To Build and Run This Application....</h2>

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate inside directory.
3. Run <code>npm install</code> .
4. Create a .env file with<br/>
   <code>MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=
   HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=
   OPENAI_KEY=</code>

**No additional servers or software needed. No need to keep data in sync. Everything is done in MongoDB Atlas.**
